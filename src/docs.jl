@doc """
`DA{T}` represents a multivariate Taylor polynomial with real coefficients of
type `T`. `DA()` defaults to `Float64`; use `DA{Float32}` or `DA{BigFloat}` for
other precisions. `DA(c)` preserves the floating-point type of `c`.

The default constructor (with no arguments) creates an empty DA object
representing the constant zero function.

""" DA

@doc """
    DA(c::Real)

Create a DA object with the constant part equal to `c`.
""" DA(c::Real)

@doc """
    DA(i::Integer, c::Real)

Create a DA object as `c` times the independent variable number `i`.
Index zero creates the constant `c`.
""" DA(i::Integer, c::Real)

@doc """
    init(order, variables; table_bytes=32*1024^2)

Initialize the global polynomial engine. Both arguments must be positive. Existing DA
values become invalid, even if the dimensions are unchanged. Configure the
engine before launching concurrent calculations. `table_bytes` caps the combined
packed multiplication and recurrence tables; larger bases use computed indices.
This does not cap polynomial or basis storage.
""" init

@doc """
    compile(p::DA)
    compile(polynomials::AbstractVector{<:DA})

Build an evaluation tree once for repeated numeric evaluation or DA composition.
`compiledDA` is the equivalent constructor. Inspect its output dimension, maximum
variable index, order and term count with `getDim`, `getVars`, `getOrd`, `getTerms`.
""" compile

@doc """
    evaluate(p, coordinates)
    evaluate(compiled, coordinates, result)

Evaluate a scalar polynomial, vector of polynomials, or compiled map. Real
coordinates produce numbers; DA coordinates compose polynomials. Missing
coordinates are zero and extra coordinates are ignored. Scalar polynomials
return scalars; maps return vectors. The three-argument form writes into `result`.

Use this for polynomial evaluation; `eval` is Julia's module evaluator.
""" evaluate

@doc """
    evaluate!(result::AbstractVector{T}, compiled, coordinates, work::AbstractVector{T})

Evaluate a compiled map numerically. With `Float32` or `Float64` buffers, this
allocates nothing after compilation. `result` must have `getDim(compiled)` entries and `work` must have at
least `getOrd(compiled)+1` entries. These buffers and the inputs must not alias.
Use `evaluate` for polynomial composition.
""" evaluate!

@doc """
    getCoefficient(p, exponents)
    getCoefficient(m::Monomial)

Read a Taylor coefficient (without factorial scaling). Missing exponents are
zero, extra exponents are ignored, and orders above the initialized maximum
return zero. Use `setCoefficient!` to change a coefficient in place.
""" getCoefficient

@doc """
    norm(p::DA, type=0)

Coefficient norm: type zero is the maximum absolute coefficient; type one is
their absolute sum; higher integer types use the corresponding power norm.
Unlike DA comparisons, this includes nonconstant coefficients.
""" norm

@doc """
    getRawMoments(mgf, order)

Return `(multi_indices, moments)` through the requested total order. `mgf` must
be a moment-generating function about zero. Taylor coefficients are multiplied
by the factorials of their exponents to recover the raw moments.
""" getRawMoments

@doc """
    getCentralMoments(mgf, order)

Return `(multi_indices, moments)` after centering the moment-generating function
at its mean. The input is assumed to have constant coefficient one.
